This is the original WWTBAM Multi Format Gameplay

Alpha v1.0 Version of WWTBAM in C++

Controls:
----------------------------------
First read the opening text!
Then Type 'y' if you want to play!
Or Press 'n' if you don't wanted to!
If you Press any other things it will finish the program!
---------------------------------------------------------
Then you can use 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
After you made you decision, Press Enter.
If you won't input either 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd' the program stops because
it will exit and return 1, so it spots as you made a huge mistake.
----------------------------
If you made it till the end you get a question about did you enjoyment!
Press 'y' if you liked it.
Or Press 'n' if you didn't.
If you Press any other things it will also finish the program!
(Btw it doesn't matter, I don't have any detecting system that gets the infos of
your choices during the game.)
--------------------------------
Thanks for giving it a try!
