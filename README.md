This is the original WWTBAM Multi Format Gameplay

Alpha v1.0 Version of WWTBAM in C++

This game is developed by a beginner who really wants to develop his own game.

As it shows, the program is written in C++.
It's the classic version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.
It's a bit harder, because there are no lifelines.
My limited coding skills cannot let me code lifelines and GUI.
There are the same questions all the time because I cannot include questions from database yet.

As my skills are improving, so will the program develop by time.
I hope you'll like it.
